# Introduction-to-the-Facebook-SDK-for-Android
This is an article that I wrote on 2019 that never published that covers the Facebook SDK for Android.

See [Introduction to the Facebook SDK for Android.](https://github.com/cenriqueortiz/Introduction-to-the-Facebook-SDK-for-Android/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20the%20Facebook%20SDK%20for%20Android%20(Jan%202019)/Introduction%20to%20the%20Facebook%20SDK%20for%20Android%20(Jan%202019).md)

**Note:** I wrote this article in early 2019 when the FB SDK for Android was version 4.x. Today mid 2020, the version is at 7.0.0, but the article is still quite accurate. Ping me if questions or other on [Twitter /eortiz](https://twitter.com/eortiz).
