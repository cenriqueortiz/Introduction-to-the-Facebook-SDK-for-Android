# Introduction to the Facebook SDK for Android
This is an article that covers the Facebook SDK for Android, written in 2019, that I never published.

See [Introduction to the Facebook SDK for Android.](https://github.com/cenriqueortiz/Introduction-to-the-Facebook-SDK-for-Android/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20the%20Facebook%20SDK%20for%20Android%20(Jan%202019)/Introduction%20to%20the%20Facebook%20SDK%20for%20Android%20(Jan%202019).md)

**Note:** While I wrote this article in early 2019 when the FB SDK for Android was version 4.x, it is still quite accurate. Ping me if questions or other on [Twitter /eortiz](https://twitter.com/eortiz).
